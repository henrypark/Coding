# Testing the Markdown

- I am free writing right now; what this means is that I'm typing my thoughts as they come; there's no filter as to what I type here.
- I long thought that this would be a good way to take down and archive notes in a digital format such that I would be able to easily access + search through;
- Now, the priority is to figure out how to archive these locally and make them easily accessible.

- I'd like to start documenting and tracking my goals + progress using Markdown and/or text files; this will help me become more familiar with VSCode.
